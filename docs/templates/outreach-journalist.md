If you cover Venezuela, corruption, sanctions, or human rights, this database can save you hours of research and provide verified, citable sources for your reporting.

## 📰 How This Helps Your Reporting

### 1. **Fast Background Checks**
- Search any Venezuelan official or businessperson in seconds
- Get sanctions status, legal cases, and known aliases
- See confidence level for each piece of information

**Example Use Case**: You're writing about a Venezuelan official. Instead of manually checking OFAC, DOJ, EU sanctions lists, search once in our database and get all verified information with source citations.

### 2. **Discover Connections**
- See who's connected to whom (business partners, family, testaferros)
- Visualize corruption networks
- Find story leads by exploring relationships

**Example Use Case**: You're investigating a sanctioned official. Our relationship map shows their testaferros, shell companies, and business partners — revealing a broader corruption network.

### 3. **Citable, Verified Sources**
- Every entry includes source URLs (OFAC, DOJ, IACHR, investigative reports)
- Confidence scores show data reliability
- Bilingual summaries save translation time

**Example Use Case**: You need to cite sanctions information in your article. Our database provides the official OFAC URL, SDN UID, and a Spanish/English summary you can quote.

### 4. **Cross-Reference Investigative Data**
- Compare official sanctions (OFAC) with investigative reporting (Armando.info, ICIJ)
- Identify individuals not yet sanctioned but linked to corruption
- Find gaps in official accountability

**Example Use Case**: You're looking for testaferros (straw men) who may not be sanctioned yet but appear in leaked documents (Panama Papers) and investigative reports.

### 5. **Track Updates**
- We monitor OFAC, EU, and DOJ for new sanctions and indictments
- RSS feed for updates (coming soon)
- Changelog shows what's new

**Example Use Case**: A new OFAC sanction drops. Instead of parsing the full SDN list, check our database for a quick summary and context.

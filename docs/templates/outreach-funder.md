## La Memoria de Venezuela — Funding Proposal for Venezuelan Accountability Database

---

**Subject**: Funding Opportunity: Scaling a Venezuelan Accountability Database for Transparency & Human Rights

---

Dear [Funder Name / Program Officer],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to introduce **La Memoria de Venezuela**, a comprehensive, open-source accountability database documenting Venezuelan regime officials, testaferros, corrupt businesses, and cultural propagandists under international sanctions and legal proceedings.

Given [Foundation Name]'s commitment to [transparency/human rights/anti-corruption/Latin America], we believe this project aligns closely with your funding priorities — and we are seeking support to scale from a working prototype to a fully operational public resource.

## 🎯 The Problem

**Impunity and information fragmentation enable continued corruption and human rights violations in Venezuela.**

- **131+ Venezuelan officials** sanctioned by OFAC (2015-2026)
- **200+ testaferros** holding billions in stolen assets
- **500+ businesses** enabling sanctions evasion and corruption
- **7.7 million displaced Venezuelans** seeking accountability
- **Information scattered** across agencies, languages, and formats — making it nearly inaccessible

**Impact**: NGOs lack comprehensive tools, journalists struggle to verify claims, businesses unknowingly engage with sanctioned entities, and future justice processes risk losing critical evidence.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**La Memoria de Venezuela** is a free, searchable, public database providing:

✅ **Verified data** from official sources (OFAC, DOJ, IACHR, EU/UK/Canada sanctions, ICIJ leaks)  
✅ **Comprehensive coverage** across five tiers:
   - TIER 1: Government officials (Ministers, military, judiciary)
   - TIER 2: Testaferros (straw men holding stolen assets)
   - TIER 3: Business enablers (corrupt companies)
   - TIER 4: Cultural propagandists (regime apologists)
   - TIER 5: International enablers (foreign collaborators)

✅ **Confidence scoring** (1-5 scale) ensuring transparency about source reliability  
✅ **Relationship mapping** visualizing networks of corruption  
✅ **Bilingual** (Spanish/English) for maximum accessibility  
✅ **Open source** (MIT license) ensuring long-term sustainability  
✅ **Free public access** — no paywalls, no user tracking

**Tech Stack**: NestJS + PostgreSQL + SvelteKit (modern, scalable, cost-effective)  
**Website**: https://github.com/takove/la-memoria-de-venezuela

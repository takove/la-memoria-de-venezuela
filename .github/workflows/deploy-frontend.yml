name: Deploy Frontend (Vercel) [DISABLED]

# NOTE: Vercel auto-deploys on every push to main (production) and creates
# preview deployments for PRs natively. This manual workflow is redundant and
# has been disabled (2026-01-05) because:
# - Vercel GitHub integration handles all deployments automatically
# - Manual workflow introduces duplicate deployment triggers
# - The `if` condition checking secrets is fragile and error-prone
#
# To re-enable: Remove [DISABLED] from name, uncomment `on:` section, and add logic
# if you need custom deployment conditions (e.g., conditional production deploys,
# pre-deployment tests, scheduled deploys).
